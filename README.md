# flutter_rick

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sudhanshu-15/FlutterRick.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sudhanshu-15/FlutterRick)

A sample Flutter application to learn and explore Flutter. The app utilizes https://rickandmortyapi.com to fetch character lists and displays them in a grid.

So far the app has a vanilla state management architecture and a BLoC (https://youtu.be/RS36gBEp8OI | https://youtu.be/PLHln7wHgPE) based architecture. Use the FAB on main screen to switch to BLoC based screen. There is a search functionality also implemented using BLoC.

There are few test cases in place to unit test fetching of data.

CI is setup using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/sudhanshu-15/FlutterRick) and there is a sample .travis.yml file for reference.
